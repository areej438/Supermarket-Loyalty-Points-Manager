# Supermarket-Loyalty-Points-Manager
This is a C++ console-based project developed as part of BS CS coursework.

## Project Overview
The project manages:
- Customer details
- Product details
- Billing system
- Loyalty points calculation and redemption

## Current Status
- Initial version implemented using arrays and functions.
- Loops are used to allow multiple products per customer.
- Input handling currently uses `cin`, which does **not support spaces** in customer or product names.
- Functions are used for customer details, product details, billing, and separation of sections.

## Future Improvements
- Improve input handling using `getline` and `cin.ignore` to allow names with spaces.
- Refactor the code using **structs** for customers and products to make it cleaner and more organized.
- Further modularization can be done if needed in future versions.

## Notes
- This version is fully functional for adding customers, products, calculating bills, and loyalty points.
- The project is under active development.
